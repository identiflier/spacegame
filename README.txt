This is just a fun little pet project by Josh Rakes.
I have almost no experience with programming, python, or game development.
The game is in a severely unfinished state right now.

In the current state, the turret only works if you're using controller input.
Apparently different controllers use different button mapping, so the controller input might not even work.

WASD to move. Click to shoot. Scroll to zoom.
Those are about all the controls there are so far.
